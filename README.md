My iOS device has been hacked for quite some time now I have been collecting and reading through the analytics from my device 
And I am on a mission to get to the source of it. I really need your help as I don't know anything about this world aside from what 
I have taught myself over the last year. 
I appreciate you all. Coding is mind blowingly amazing to me. Takes some serious brains so so big up to all of you
